# feeding

[Here](https://feed.unseen-site.fun/) you can feed me.

You can also ~~clone this repository~~ execute the command below to play with it.

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-net --unstable-kv https://github.com/NaitLee/feeding/raw/main/main.ts
```

Uses [Deno KV](https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.4/runtime/kv) for global counting. Formerly its [Countapi](https://countapi.xyz/) but the service is down for a long time.

The purpose of this little stuff is to see if SVG is powerful enough to do such things, and have fun.
